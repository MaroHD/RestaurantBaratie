# *- Notes*:

- The Current Verison of The Bot is the Alpha Verison so it wont be as fast as intended, Which we plan on improving the bot in the offical release of the bot,So please be patient.

- Bot Prefix is " - ", We also do have Slash Commands but we don't support different language orders for slash commands.

- The Bot delivers common requested orders fast by time to improve the Speed of Delivery, But as soon as the order is accurate you will receive it fast.

- We have Human Cooks, So please have some respect for the Cooks.

- The bot is available in many different languages, More information about languages will be posted in the Wiki of this Github Repo

- "English Named" and "Original Named" orders usually comes faster than "Non English Named" or "Non Original Named" orders, So its best to stick with "English Name" or "The Original Name" of the order you want, The Delivery Speed Improvement System doesn't work for any orders that are not their "English Name" or "The Original Name", Because it will take time to arrive.
